# Simon Says
Play a game of Simon.


Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

Current functionalities include:
* A sound and "light up" animation that corresponds to each button plays both when the series of button presses plays, and when the player personally presses a button.
* Play on normal mode, where if a wrong button is pressed, the game will let the player know, will play the series of button presses again, and will let the player try again.
